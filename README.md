Additive Bearing
================

A competition to use 3D printing to build a weight bearing spanning structure.

### Guidelines

* The 3D printed structure must be printed in one job
* The material will be PLA
* The gap to span will be 4" inches
* The maximum width (span) of the final structure will be 5" inches
* The maximum height of the final structure will be 4" inches
* The maximum depth of the final structure will be 4" inches
* The load will be applied in the center of the span from a single point of attatchment

The score of your bridge will be determined by the ratio between the strength (i.e., maximum
load applied), divided by the weight of your bridge immediately before the competition.
